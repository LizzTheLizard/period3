<div class="article2"><p>Frieza is one of the villains in the Dragon Ball manga and the Dragon Ball Z anime. He also appears in several Dragon Ball Z movies, as well as Dragon Ball GT episodes. Frieza is a galactic emperor who runs the planet trade and is feared for his ruthlessness and power. He is the descendant of Chilled, the son of King Cold, the younger brother of Cooler, and the father of Kuriza.</p>

<p>Cell is a supervillain who comes from a future timeline in the Dragon Ball manga and the Dragon Ball Z anime. He is the ultimate creation of Dr. Gero, designed to have all the abilities of the greatest fighters to have ever inhabited or visited Earth; the result is a "perfect warrior", possessing numerous favorable genetic traits and special abilities. Cell is one of the few Red Ribbon Androids not directly completed by Dr. Gero; the others are Android 15, Android 14, Android 13, and possibly Android 8. Cell, Androids 13, 14, and 15's completions involve Dr. Gero's Super Computer.</p>

<p>Kid , also known as Majin Buu , is the original and purest form of the Majin called Buu. The first form of Buu that appeared in Dragon Ball Z was actually the form that he took after he had absorbed Southern Supreme Kai and Grand Supreme Kai millions of years earlier, and Kid Buu appeared again only after all of the fighters he had absorbed were removed from his system. Kid Buu is the final villain of the Dragon Ball manga. Unlike his other forms, this form of Buu's thought process is seen to be irrational and spontaneous, even destroying his own body to destroy the Earth. Although he appears smaller than any other form, he is more dangerous than any other forms of Buu due to his full relentless evil and unpredictability. He is also completely free of restraint and has no trace of sanity and, because of this, is extremely volatile. He retains his childish personality, becoming amused and laughing hysterically at his own destruction of entire worlds.</p>
