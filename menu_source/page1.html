He is based on Sun Wukong, a main character in the classical Chinese novel Journey to the West. Goku is introduced in chapter #1 Bulma and Son Goku, originally published in Japan's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984, as an eccentric, monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. Goku is initially believed to be an Earthling, but is later revealed to be a member of an extraterrestrial warrior race called the Saiyans. He later discovers his birth name, Kakarrot.
In Dragon Ball, Goku trains himself in martial arts in his deceased grandfather's mountain home. He meets Bulma who is searching for the Dragon Balls. Bulma notices Goku's power and asks Goku to join her after explaining the legend of the wish-granting Dragon Balls. As Goku matures, he becomes one of the universe's mightiest warriors and protects his adopted home planet, Earth, from villains who wish to harm it. Goku is depicted as carefree and aloof when at ease but quickly serious and strategic-minded when fighting. Goku is able to concentrate his Ki and use it for devastatingly powerful energy-based attacks, the most prominent being his signature Kamehameha technique, in which Goku launches a blue energy blast from his palms.
As the protagonist, Goku appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials, and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT, as well as many of the franchise's video games. Due to the series' international popularity, Goku has become one of the most recognizable and iconic anime characters in the world. Outside the Dragon Ball franchise, Goku has made cameo appearances in Toriyama's self-parody series Neko Majin Z, has been the subject of other parodies, and has appeared in special events. Most Western audiences were introduced to the adult version of Goku appearing in the Dragon Ball Z anime, itself an adaptation of Dragon Ball manga volumes 17-42, as opposed to his initial child form, due to the limited success of the first series overseas.Goku's critical reception has been largely positive and he has been recognized as the greatest manga/anime character of all time.</P><p>Through vigorous training, Goku has achieved many extraordinary abilities, like incredible super strength and durability. He also possesses super speed[35] and reflexes. He can harness/manipulate supernatural energy known as Ki and exert powerful and devastating concussive beams of said energy.
As a child, Goku wields the  "Power Pole" , a magic staff that extends and retracts on command, given to him by his Grandfather; but as he grows older and stronger, Goku eventually stops using the staff. Goku's first means of conveyance is a magic cloud called "Nimbus" , given to him by Kame-Sen'nin in return for saving his pet sea turtle. After training with Kami, he learns to fly by virtue of the technique  "Air Dance Technique" and uses the cloud less frequently.
Goku's signature move is the Kamehameha , a technique learned from Kame-Sen'nin. The Kamehameha is created when you concentrate all of your body's latent energy and focusing it at one point. Kame-Sen'nin spent about 50 years to create the technique, but Goku performed a miniature version of the technique in his first try, which was enough to damage a car.
Another notable technique of Goku's, taught to him by Kaiō-sama, is the Kaiō-ken, an attack that multiplies his Ki and strength for an instant, but can also strain his body afterwards, or could even kill him.Goku's most powerful attack is the "Spirit Bomb", an energy sphere created by gathering Ki from surrounding animals, nature and humans, which he also learned from Kaiō-sama.Goku also learns a teleportation skill called  "Instant Transmission" , which he learned from the inhabitants of the planet Yardrat.
Goku is the only Saiyan in the series to achieve all known Saiyan transformations. In Dragon Ball, he can transform into a gigantic monkey-like creature called an Ōzaru when he stares at a full moon while possessing a Saiyan tail. Goku loses the ability to make this transformation when his friends cut off his tail. Although it grows back, Goku's tail is later permanently removed by Kami. Goku becomes the first Super Saiyan  in a thousand years; becoming enraged when Freeza kills Kuririn on the planet Namek. Each metamorphosis changes Goku's appearance and enormously enhances his abilities. After training to better control the 1st and 2nd Levels of Super Saiyan, the 3rd Super Saiyan form causes Goku to act in a much more serious manner.
Another ability Goku has is to fuse with others, so long as their power levels are equalized. In the Majin Boo arc, he uses the Potara Earrings presented to him by the Old Kaiō-shin, which results in a "perfect fusion", but it's a permanent fusion. Goku first attempts to fuse with Gohan, but this fails when the latter is absorbed by Boo, and so he persuades the newly arrived Vegeta to fuse with him, creating Vegito . In the film Fusion Reborn, the two use the Metamorese Fusion Dance, which creates Gogeta , who sports slight visual differences from their previous merger. </p>
